# Tomato-disease-classifier
Plant disease classification using tomato plant leaves based on CNN Architecture
 
 
 
 
 
## DESCRIPTIONS :-

#### <a href="https://github.com/layba-s/tomato-disease-classifier/blob/master/tomato-densenet.ipynb">tomato-densenet.ipynb</a>
This file contains complete python code to train a neural networks model using tomato leaf dataset that classifies a tomato leaf image into 10 different categories
with 97% accuracy.

#### <a href="https://github.com/layba-s/tomato-disease-classifier/blob/master/tomato-trial.ipynb">tomato-trial.ipynb</a>
This file contains complete python code to test the trained neural networks model on few tomato leaf images (which are picked randomly from google) and detect the type of disease they are affected with.

## COMPLETE GUIDE TO USE THE REPOSITORY :-

#### 1. Download the dataset to train the model
<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/kaustubhb999/tomatoleaf">tomato leaf dataset</a>

#### 2. Run <a href="https://github.com/layba-s/tomato-disease-classifier/blob/master/tomato-densenet.ipynb">tomato-densenet.ipynb</a> file and download the weights.
OR
Use the pre-trained weight file from the repository.

#### 3. Run <a href="https://github.com/layba-s/tomato-disease-classifier/blob/master/tomato-trial.ipynb">tomato-trial.ipynb</a> file and implement it on any infected tomato leaf image of your choice.
